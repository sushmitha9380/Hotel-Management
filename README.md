## Overview

This Hotel Management System is a Python-based console application that simulates basic hotel operations such as room bookings, guest checkouts, and room availability tracking. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to model hotel rooms and their interactions. Users can view available rooms with details, book rooms for guests based on room type, and manage checkoutsâ€”all through a simple text-based menu system.

The project is ideal for learning how to:

- Use classes and objects in Python
- Work with user input and control flow
- Simulate a real-world system in code
